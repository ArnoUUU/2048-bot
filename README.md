# 2048-bot

##### Goal: A bot to beat 2048 in an optimal enough way to consistently win

##### Currently: Uses single-state recursion to checks which move will have the most empty spots(with depth that you can decide as the user), and calculates which is the best move.
##### Should have a 100% wwinrate above a depth of 2
