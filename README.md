# 2048-bot

##### Goal: A bot to beat 2048 in an optimal enough way to consistently win

##### Currently: Uses recursion to checks which move will have the most empty spots(with depth that you can decide as the user), and calculates which is the best move. This works surprisingly well, but takes a significant amount of processing power and is inconsistent
